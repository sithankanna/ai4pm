# Notes on Problem Solving

## Guiding Principles
0. You can solve the problem with the information, resources, mental capacity you have - "You are enbough to solve the problem"
1. Belief that thinking alone can help you get to the answers.
2. Reduce reliance of consuming information


## Problem Solving Mechanics
1. Define problem
    * Use Situation, Complication, Question Technique
2. Identify drivers of problems
    * Use the 5 Whys?
    * Use issue tree
    * Make drivers as mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive MECE as possible
3. Prioritise drivers (branches of issue tree)
    * Do back of the envelope estimates to prioritise impact of the drivers
4. Develop hypotheses for each driver
5. Sketch out graphs that would prove/disprove hypotheses

## Other Principles

1. Drive to early output
    * "Outcome first": Plan what the end of the project would like and work backwards
    * Can I get an intermediate answer (indication of the answer) to this question without doing a the full analysis?
    * Can I output in stages? E.g. Instead of sending a whole deck, can I send it in batches.
    * Instead of getting stalled in a step, can you assume an answer (or possible answers) and proceed.
2. "So what?"
    * If I get an answer to this question, how will it  change my thinking?
3. Hypothesis driven approach
    * Do not attempt to answer your question by first looking into the data  hoping that that the information you are gathering will help guide your thinking
    * Think first, gather information second
    * "How do I do X?" Should immediately follow "I think X can be solved using Y and that will hold if A, B and C are true".
    * In an extreme setting - all information should either serve to test your hypotheses or irrelevant.
4. All structuring is in re-structuring
    * Don't get fooled by issue trees that are drawn in one pass. In reality, you will draw an issue tree and go back and change it and repeat the process.
    * Good thinking is done in private, no need to impress someone with fluency.
5. The Toothbrush Test
   * Used to see how specific/tailor-made your hypothesis questions are to the question at hand
   * Technique: When you come up with an issue, ask yourself, can I change the industry/company (e.g a toothbrush company) and see if the question is valid. If it is still valid, then the statement failed the toothbrush test 
* Elevator Pitch 
    * Distilling Insights
    * What still needs to do and what help is neede
* Be bold to get early Alignment 
* Donâ€™t be afraid to manage expectations
* Build Interim checkins
