# Notes on Problem Solving

1. Define problem
    * Use Situation, Complication, Question Technique
2. Identify drivers of problems
    * Use the 5 Whys?
    * Use issue tree
    * Make drivers as mutually exclusive, collectively exhastive MECE as possible
3. Prioritise drivers (branches of issue tree)
    * Do back of the envelope estimates to prioritise impact of the drivers
4. Develop hypotheses for each driver
5. Sketch out graphs that would prove/disprove hypotheses

## Other Principles

1. Drive to early output
    * "Outcome first": Plan what the end of the project would like and work backwards
    * Can I get an intermediate answer (indication of the answer) to this question without doing a the full analysis?
    * Can I output in stages? E.g. Instead of sending a whole deck, can I send it in batches.
    * Instead of getting stalled in a step, can you assume an answer (or possible answers) and proceed.
2. "So what?"
    * If I get an answer to this question, how will it  change my thinking?
